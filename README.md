## Process
It involved creating the wireframes and hi fi wireframes and made changes after getting feedback from my peer group 

## Challenges

The overlapping of some of the classes with bootsrap created a bug I was unable to solve. It effected the hierachy of the code and I couldn't find out whether it was due to Bootsrap library or vanilla CSS. 
## What I Learned ?
 Learning web development is consistent effort. Its not like you can code 1 day and then touch the code after 4 days . You need to be consistent with coding like having your food but also be willing to help out others bugs and issues because doing so you learn even more.
